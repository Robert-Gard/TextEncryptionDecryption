# # This is a Message Encryption script in Python created for school.

It is a text encryption/decryption script that asks for an inital message to be encrypted.
It then asks the user for a value to use to encrypt and then later decrypt the message (either ascii or UTF-8).

The message is encrypted, and the encoded message is shown to the user.
The script then pretends to be "working" to decode the encoded message back to the original message for a few seconds, before showing the user their original message, now decoded using the method they chose.
